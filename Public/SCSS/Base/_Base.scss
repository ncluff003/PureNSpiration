    //////////////////////////////////
    /// To Do List:

    MUSTDO : Record A Short Video finishing my introduction on the About Section.
    MUSTDO : Push what I have to Namecheap.com on my domain listed as Purenspiration.com
    MUSTDO : Finish by doing a final review, add, commit, & push to my local repo to be sure of what is needed there.
    MUSTDO : Update my links on the project cards & re-push to Namecheap.com for my site.
    MUSTDO : Clean up code on my site to make it both readable & still efficient WHILE applying for jobs.
    MUSTDO : Again, while applying for jobs, I will be needing to make my site much more mobile friendly.  This will be done by refreshing my mind on what CSS I need to be doing in order for that to be achieved.  While doing this one with media queries, I can also clean up my SCSS.
    MUSTDO : While applying for jobs, keep working on the budget site & reset these goals on the base scss file for that budget.
    MUSTDO : Polish up my responsive design for my site.  Particularly, the project cards & maybe the Skill Cards and Contact Form.  For Troublesome sizes, I will need JavaScript To Handle Some Styling because of the inline styles it is already creating.
    
    
    //////////////////////////////////
    /// Glitches To Fix

    GLITCH : Gradient Overlay of Mobile Portrait Small does not stay at the bottom of the container.  It scrollw WITH the container items.

    //////////////////////////////////
    /// Adjustments To Make

    ADJUST : Remove Arrow Functions from Methods.
    ADJUST : Refactor Code to make it so functions / methods only use up to 5 parameters max.
    ADJUST : Remove unecessary style rules in my email stylesheet.
    ADJUST : Readjust so every file imports the same variables, AND mixins.


    //////////////////////////////////
    /// Features To Implement

    FEATURE : Responsive Design according to the screen that is used by the client.
    FEATURE : Mobile navigation with the hamburger menu.
